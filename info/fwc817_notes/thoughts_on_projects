- Interactive nodes:
  - Reservations: https://slurm.schedmd.com/reservations.html
  - PrologSlurmctld: https://slurm.schedmd.com/prolog_epilog.html
    - Can failure handling be modified so batch jobs don't get requeued forever?
    - Are all relevant information available? Otherwise another prolog type
      should be used

- cgroups https://slurm.schedmd.com/cgroups.html
  - Ideally: restrict memory, CPU resources, and GPUs
  - Should ssh access to compute nodes be disabled for regular users?
  - This incentivises overallocating resources. How can this be offset?
